  <p class="lead">
    Hello! Welcome to the <strong>Rick and Morty</strong> fan page. I created this project to explore and share information about the characters, episodes, and places from this fun and chaotic universe that I love.
  </p>

  <p>
    I use the <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/" target="_blank">Rick and Morty API</a> to bring updated and accurate data about characters, episodes, and much more.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Technologies I Used</h2>

    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Vite for build and development server</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-4">About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This is a personal project, created for educational purposes and as a way to practice my development skills. I have no commercial affiliation with the Rick and Morty brand â€” all rights belong to its creators.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you enjoy browsing and discover some fun facts about your favorite characters!
